1. Only from the readings, here are the key points: key principles of pricing, services with no charges, and What IT infrastructure is.

2. Quote 1: "* Note: The main difference between AWS accounts and AISPL accounts is the seller of record. AWS accounts are administered by Amazon Web Services, Inc., but AISPL accounts are administered by Amazon Internet Services Private Limited. If you used an Indian address when you created your account, your account's default seller of record is AISPL. By default, AISPL accounts are billed in Indian Rupees (INR)." I quoted that because it goes to show that services have their distinct style of delpoyment, creation, and most of all, using Consolidatation Billing. Quote 2, "Information technology (IT) infrastructure are the components required to operate and manage enterprise IT environments. IT infrastructure can be deployed within a cloud computing system, or within an organization's own facilities." That's quoted because then after, you need to learn the inclusions of hardware, software, networking components, an operating system, and data storage. Finally, quote 3, "In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS services within the same region." Even though their will be exceptions, within reading this section, it was intersting to learn because it seemed important how outbound data is aggregated across services, and the more data you transfer, the less money you pay per GB.

3. New facts I learned are that adopting cloud services is a technical evolution, and requires changes to how organizations operate. Another fact is you being able to AWS services free of charges, within certain limits (Section 5). Last new fact is avioding charges while on the free tier by keeping your usage below the free tier limits.

4. As I am new to this, even after the first 3 three notes, I probably won't have questions at all.
